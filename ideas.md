# Bowling.IO (name a work in progress)


# Some class ideas:

## Tow Truck 
A powerful, tanky truck that can survive a lot of damage and pull the bowling ball effectively.
### Attacks
  - **Coal Roll**: exhausts a large cloud of black fumes that poisons the affected cars
  - **Tail Whip**: short ranged attack by the tow that yanks the struck car towards the tow truck
### Ultimate
  - **Plant**: the tow truck becomes completely static, causing its tether to drag the ball out of its trajectory. The tow truck cuts its tether with the ball

## Dimetrodon
A speedy, maneuverable car that carries a sharp fin on its back. This fin makes it capable of ramming into other cars with very little concern for its own health
### Attacks
  - **Gattling Gun**: short ranged weapon that fires quick bullets rapidly, rapidly swivels to any angle
  - **Deadly Charge**: accelerates in one direction towards the targeted mouse position. Any cars struck are knocked up and damaged, scaling with final speed
### Ultimate
  - **Scissor Flurry**: scissors emerge from the car, making it able to cut tethers for a short duration

## Hardware Truck
A pickup truck that "accidentally" drops nails onto the road
### Attacks
  - **Nail Gun**: a long range hitscan weapon that does extra damage upon striking tires, slows cars down. Fires from the front of the car
  - **Tack Trap**: a small patch of tacks on the road that damages affected cars and slows them down
### Ultimate
  - **Spike Strips**: the car speeds up and places a strip of **Tack Traps** behind itself

## Panzer
A slow moving tank that carries a powerful gun and is capable of crushing anyone too slow to escape
### Attacks
  - **Massive Turret**: a turret mounted cannon that fires powerful hitscan shots. Capable of any angle, but slow to swivel
  - **Mortar**: fires a long range shot straight into the air that lands at the targeted location
### Ultimate
  - **Supercharge**: the engine becomes supercharged, enabling the tank to move faster and its turret to swivel quicker 

## Drifter
The ultimate racing machine: unmatched maneuverability and acceleration, with an explosive twist
### Attacks
  - **Shotgun**: a close range weapon that fires several shots forwards
  - **Explosive Drift**: the vehicle performs a drift. Any vehicles struck by the side of the drifter are damaged and knocked airborne
### Ultimate
  - ****


# Terrain features:
  - **Obstacles**: these elements are either natural land forms or man made buildings that are completely indestructible. Can be crashed into
  - **Pits**: holes in the ground that can cause certain death (can be in the form of lakes, mineshafts, cliffs)
  - **Poles**: objects from which cars can attach their grapple. They can be used to swing in order to generate a speed boost
  - **Ramps**: obstacles that can be climbed on top of to become airborne (kinda like a blast cone)
  - **Obstructions**: destructible elements that cause the vehicle to slow down when crashed into (maybe cactus, bushes, fence posts)
  - **Refueling Stations**: 
  - **Entrance Ramps**: respawn points that occur along the length of the highway (3 per team) where destroyed cars can reenter the game
